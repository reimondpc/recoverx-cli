## [0.5.5] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** — `ci.yml` (pytest + flake8 + black + isort + mypy + bandit on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12), `release.yml` (tag validation, version check, packaging verification)
- **Test coverage system** — `pytest-cov` configured for source coverage with terminal/XML/HTML reporting
- **Fuzz testing framework** — `tests/fuzz/test_fat32_fuzz.py` covers corrupted boot sectors, malformed directory entries, self-referencing FAT loops, bad clusters, random FAT chains, extreme BPB values, zero-size images, and memory safety edge cases
- **Stress datasets** — `tests/datasets/create_stress_images.py` generates fragmented images (50+ files), deep directories (20 levels), partially overwritten files, FAT self-loops, orphan clusters, and large images
- **Recovery validation suite** — `tests/validation/test_recovery_quality.py` measures precision, recovery rate, metadata integrity, hash consistency, and subdirectory traversal quality
- **Advanced logging** — FORENSIC level (15) added for audit-grade recovery trails; thread ID and logger name in file logs
- **Performance profiler** — `Profiler` context manager with CPU, RAM, and throughput metrics; `profile_operation` decorator for function-level profiling; JSON export
- **Architecture registries** — `scanner/__init__.py`, `filesystems/__init__.py`, `carving/__init__.py`, `reporting/__init__.py` with register/get/list for future plugin loading
- **Static analysis** — `mypy` (strict typing checks) and `bandit` (security scanning) configured in `pyproject.toml`

### Changed

- **Logger** — now accepts `console_level` and `file_level` parameters; FORENSIC level (15) for audit trails; enhanced file log format with thread IDs
- **Validate boot sector** — early return on `sectors_per_cluster == 0` to prevent `ZeroDivisionError` in `total_clusters`
- **Packaging** — `build` and `twine` added as dev dependencies; wheel and sdist verified clean

### Infrastructure

- 216 total pytest tests (29 new: 21 fuzz, 8 validation, stress dataset generators)
- Coverage: 81% overall, FAT32 critical modules >88%
- Version bumped to 0.5.5

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **FAT32 boot sector parser** — `parse_boot_sector()` reads and validates BPB fields (OEM ID, cluster/sector geometry, FAT size, volume label, signature)
- **FAT32 directory traversal** — `parse_directory_entries()` decodes SFN + LFN (0x0F) entries, handles deleted markers (0xE5), free markers (0x00); `walk_directory_tree()` recursively visits subdirectories
- **FAT cluster chain reader** — `read_cluster_chain()` follows FAT32 FAT entries with loop/bad-cluster/free/zero detection; `read_cluster_data()` reads individual clusters; `read_chain_data()` aggregates cluster data
- **Deleted file recovery** — `FAT32Recovery.find_deleted_entries()` scans directory trees for 0xE5-marked entries; `recover_deleted_file()` reconstructs cluster chains, truncates to declared size, computes SHA-256
- **CLI commands** — `recoverx fat32 info`, `list`, `deleted`, `recover` with `--json` output for all subcommands
- **Test image generator** — `tests/fat32/create_fat32_image.py` builds reproducible FAT32 images with normal files, deleted files, subdirectories, and volume labels

### Changed

- **CLI** — `fat32` subcommand group registered via `app.add_typer(fat32_app)` in `main.py`

### Infrastructure

- 187 total pytest tests (76 new: FAT32 boot sector, FAT table, directory, recovery, integration, CLI)
- Version bumped to 0.5.0

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **GIF carving** — `GIFCarver` supports both GIF87a and GIF89a formats with 4 MB lookback
- **BMP carving** — `BMPCarver` uses the file size declared in the BMP header to extract complete images
- **PDF carving** — `PDFCarver` extracts PDFs via `%PDF` / `%%EOF` markers with 8 MB lookback
- **Memory-mapped scanner** — `MmapScanner` uses `mmap` for zero-copy reads with automatic fallback to streaming on failure or huge files
- **Multithreaded scanner** — `ThreadedScanner` partitions images into overlapping regions and scans them in parallel; configurable thread count via `--threads`
- **Advanced benchmark** — `AdvancedBenchmark` tracks CPU%, peak RSS, files/min, and per-thread timing; exports to JSON
- **JSON forensic reports** — `JSONReport` writes structured output with `scan_info`, `benchmark`, and per-file metadata (offset, size, SHA‑256, path)
- **Filesystem detection** — automatic identification of FAT12/16/32, exFAT, NTFS, and ext2/3/4 from the boot sector / superblock (read-only)
- **Hash database** — persistent `HashDatabase` stores SHA‑256 digests across runs; provides dedup and statistics
- **Direct disk access** — `recoverx devices` command lists all connected disks and raw block devices with optional `--detailed` probe
- **Device validation** — scanning raw devices (`/dev/sdX`) shows safety warnings and permission checks

### Changed

- **CLI overhaul** — `recoverx scan` now accepts `--threads`, `--report`, `--no-mmap`, `--chunk-size` flags
- **Scan pipeline** — automatically selects the best scanner (threaded > mmap > streaming) based on source size and flags
- **Signature registry** — extended with GIF, BMP, PDF entries
- **Sample image generator** — now embeds GIF, BMP, and PDF test files alongside JPEGs and PNGs

### Infrastructure

- 111 total pytest tests (67 new: GIF, BMP, PDF carvers, mmap, threading, benchmark, reports, FS detection, hash DB, CLI)
- Cross-boundary file detection tested with configurable chunk/overlap sizes
- Version bumped to 0.4.0

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **PNG carving** — new `PNGCarver` using the standard PNG signature (`\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n`) and IEND chunk marker (`\x00\x00\x00\x00IEND\xae\x42\x60\x82`)
- **SHA-256 hashing** — `HashManager` computes SHA-256 digests for every recovered file, displayed in CLI output and available for deduplication and integrity verification
- **Chunked streaming scanner** — `StreamingScanner` processes images in configurable chunks (default 4 MB) with overlapping windows so memory usage stays bounded regardless of source size
- **Scan benchmarking** — `ScanBenchmark` measures elapsed time, throughput (MB/s), and file count displayed at the end of every scan

### Changed

- **Scan pipeline** — `recoverx scan` now uses the streaming scanner with all registered carvers (JPEG + PNG), hashing, and benchmark reporting
- **Sample image generator** — `tests/create_sample.py` now embeds both JPEG and PNG test files

### Infrastructure

- 44 total pytest tests (21 new: PNG carver, hashing, streaming scanner)
- Cross-boundary file detection tested with configurable chunk/overlap sizes
- Version bumped to 0.3.0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **RawReader** — read-only binary reader for disk images (`.img`, `.dd`, `.raw`) and block devices with sector-level and offset-level access
- **RecoveryManager** — auto-incrementing output file naming per extension, output directory creation
- **File signature registry** — centralised `SIGNATURES` dict in `core/carving/signatures.py` for easy format addition
- **BaseCarver ABC** — abstract base class enforcing a consistent `carve(data: bytes) -> list[CarvedFile]` interface

- **Typer CLI** — `recoverx info` and `recoverx scan <path>` commands with `--help`
- **Rich output** — colourised console, progress bars (`rich.progress`), formatted tables (`rich.table`)
- **Dual logging** — `RichHandler` for console (INFO+) and rotated file handler for `logs/recoverx.log` (DEBUG+)
- **`src/` layout** — standard Python `src/`-layout package with setuptools `packages.find`
- **pytest test suite** — 23 tests covering `RawReader`, `JPEGCarver`, `RecoveryManager`, and signature registry
- **Linting toolchain** — `black`, `isort`, `flake8` configured with consistent 100-char line length
- **Sample image generator** — `tests/create_sample.py` produces a 10 MB `.img` with two embedded JPEGs at known offsets

### Changed

- Migrated source tree from flat layout to `src/recoverx/` (src-layout)
- Refactored all cross-package imports from relative `from core.xxx` to absolute `from recoverx.core.xxx`
- Updated `pyproject.toml` for modern setuptools with `where = ["src"]` discovery

- `.gitignore` excluding virtual environments, build artifacts, test outputs, and disk images
- `requirements.txt` for quick dependency install without optional dev extras
- `.flake8` configuration for line-length and rule exclusions
